# # #====================================# # #

# Models the probability of recruitment of individual pieces of large wood via wind throw, bank erosion, or mortality
# Based on the equation ((He/Ht)/2) + ((0.5 - (0.5/10 ^ (1.4375 * B)))/2) + (D/4)
# Ht - Total tree height, derived from LANDFIRE EVH | He - Effective height
# B - Unitless slope | D - Density
